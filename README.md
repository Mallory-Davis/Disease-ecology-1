This EpiTriad shows the relationships between the environment, host and pathogen. The EpiTriad is the best understanding of disease ecology. 
The host in this triad explains the host heterogeneity. The pathogen shows coinfection, evolution and pathogen biology. The enviroment shows things like climate change. 
Between host and pathogen's, we can see things similar to range expansion and vector biology.
Disease- The absence of health.
There is a line we used to show the inbetweens from "absolute health" and "death". Included in this line is relative health, infection, disease and signs/symptoms.
The BIG FIVE:  
  Virus: MPOX
